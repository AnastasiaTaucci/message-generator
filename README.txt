# 🌿 Daily Grounding

A minimalist one-page affirmation app to help you pause, breathe, and reconnect — especially in a world that moves too fast and often feels overwhelming. As we scroll through perfect lives and polished success on Instagram, this simple tool offers something gentler: a grounding message to bring you back to yourself.

## ✨ What It Does

- Generates calming, grounding messages made of three soft, thoughtful parts
- Designed as a gentle reminder to pause and breathe
- No distractions, no features — just stillness

## 💻 Why I Built It

This is a small personal project to:
- Practice working with HTML5 UP templates
- Use **plain TypeScript** and compile it manually
- Get familiar with styling using **plain CSS** (with Tailwind-style structure in mind)
- Understand how to structure simple one-page apps with real-world layout tools

I built this for myself — and for anyone who needs a quiet breath in their day.
